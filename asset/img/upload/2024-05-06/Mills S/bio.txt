Mills is a Saint Louis native who earned their BFA from Maryville University in 2014, and became a licensed tattoo artist in 2019. Their time studying fine art in Italy, along with their Catholic upbringing, has heavily influenced their work. They made their name by bringing ignorant style to St. Louis, and have since broadened their body of work to include black and gray illustrative pieces. Their work focuses on subverting Catholic and Americana imagery to reflect the queer experience. As a trans non-binary tattoo artist, Mills strives to create a safe and empowering environment with trauma informed practices. Explore their available flash on instagram @needlegardens
