Melissa began her apprenticeship under the guidance of Laura Bonfanti in the spring of 2021 and has been tattooing since June 2021. Melissa was born and raised in St. Louis and has dreamt of becoming a tattoo artist for over a decade. She graduated Summa Cum Laude with a BA in Art History from Arizona State University in 2020, and decided to pursue her dream of becoming a tattoo artist after graduation.

Melissa is inspired by botanical illustrations, animals (especially cats), ukiyo-e, Studio Ghibli, surrealism and abstraction. Melissa enjoys tattooing whimsical and colorful designs as well as fineline illustrative blackwork, and welcomes other styles of tattooing so that she can grow as an artist.
