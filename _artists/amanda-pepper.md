Amanda has been an artist her whole life. Drawing led to illustration, collage, painting, and then tattooing. She is fascinated with art as self expression, and believes the process of getting a tattoo can be a very personal and meaningful experience. Amanda is inspired by plants, animals, scenery, abstract art, and philosophy. Currently her focus is solely on custom original pieces that involve this theme of nature. Her tattoo work is typically colorful and soft, semi-realistic, with thin or minimal outline.

Currently, Amanda is in a time of transition and is not taking any new appointments. To keep up with Amanda and follow her work, visit her blog at [bemycanvas.com](http://bemycanvas.com/)
