Amanda is a multimedia artist. She enjoys painting, illustration, tattooing, and graphic design.
Her tattoo work is colorful, soft, and semi-realistic, usually depicting plants or animals. She loves doing pet portrait illustration and abstract intuitive painting.

Amanda finds her inspiration in nature, as well as concepts of spirituality, dreams, energy, folklore and philosophy, healing and wellness. She also likes working with symbolism and bright color.

In recent years, Amanda pursued interest in the healing arts to receive training as an advanced Reiki practitioner. Her current area of focus is integrating trauma-informed principles into her life and work.

She is passionate about her purpose as an artist to connect the client with an image, whether it be on paper, skin, pixel, or canvas.
