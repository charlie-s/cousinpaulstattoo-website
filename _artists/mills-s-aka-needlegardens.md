Mills hails from St. Louis and feels privileged to also have earned their BFA from Maryville University, which included an impactful study abroad program in Italy that has influenced much of their art. As a trans, non-binary artist, they strive to create safe spaces for their clients and to be both accessible and approachable. Mills is currently focused in the ignorant style of tattooing – mostly linework pieces with a rebellious, tongue-in-cheek vibe. Check out Mills' Instagram (@needlegardens) for available flash designs or contact them for a custom piece that suits your sense of humor.
