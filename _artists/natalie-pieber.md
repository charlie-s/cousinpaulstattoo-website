Natalie has been a lover of art ever since she was a kid. She has always found art to be a universal escape and can’t remember a time in life when she didn’t have a sketchbook in her hand. 

Despite having a desire to be a tattoo artist from a young age, Natalie obtained a degree in Psychology and then went on to become a licensed tattoo artist in 2021. Natalie has a niche for fine line and dotwork but also loves colorful and fun tattoos as well as making spontaneous designs for walk-ins. 

One of the most fulfilling aspects of tattooing for Natalie is the connection it can bring, which is why being a safe and inclusive space for all clients is a top priority for her. Follow @natzaps on Instagram to be connected or visit her website below for scheduling:
