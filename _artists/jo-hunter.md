Well versed in cat whispering and collector of shiny objects, Jo Hunter was born and raised in St. Louis with a creative mind and an eye for whimsical art. When not collecting cool rocks or inspecting their fiddle leaf fig for mealy bugs, they can be found tattooing and drawing up the next custom piece on their list. Jo prides themselves in creating an inclusive and safe space for all people, whether it is your first tattoo or hundredth, and feels that the art of tattooing should be accessible to all.  Gathering inspiration from nature, fantasy novels, the occult, and images of tiny frogs with hats, Jo specializes in black and grey illustrative, with the occasional pop of of color (typically red or green).

Jo is always dropping new flash via their Instagram and is taking inquiries for custom tattoos via their [custom Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqSxEfdCkcUgpX9VA62kOUUyOlvWXKwOWD4409zV2H5hiuoA/viewform). Jo’s books are always open!
