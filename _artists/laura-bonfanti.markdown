Laura Bonfanti, a tattooer, and the owner of CPTC, was born in St. Louis City and graduated from CVPA High School, class of 1991 where she majored in visual art, and minored in photography, creative writing and silversmithing. She began tattooing in 1996 when she realized she could take her interests in visual art, cultural anthropology, healing arts, and body adornment and combine them into work as a tattooer. Her career began under the apprenticeship of R. Hammer Madison and ‘Tatu’ Tony DiPietro. near Daytona, FL. It was here that she earned the nickname “BoraBoraLaura”.

When she moved back to St. Louis in 2010, she knew she wanted to be back home on the South Side for good. She is excited to welcome you to her studio in lovely SOHA. Her diversity of experience with many different, talented artists and varied clientele during her travels over the years have helped her hone her skills in a variety of styles and techniques. She is happy to help you with a small traditional butterfly, a portrait of your dog, a sleeve of skulls, a soft floral, or a cover up of that certain tattoo which wasn’t as cool as it should have been. She can meet almost any request.
