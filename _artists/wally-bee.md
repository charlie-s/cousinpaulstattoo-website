St. Louis born and raised, Wally has been tattooing for 9 years. Widely experienced in lettering and traditional tattooing as well as other popular styles. Although hand-drawn lettering has become a “lost art” to most, Wally’s focus on lettering has been ongoing for over a decade. Whether it’s a quote, verse, name, or even a single letter... he will knock it out of the park. Bring him your tattoo ideas in the shop or email for info.
