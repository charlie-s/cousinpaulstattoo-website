                <strong>How much will my tattoo cost?</strong>
                <p>There are many factors that determine the price of a tattoo. Size, location, level of detail, and style are some of these. The best way to find out how much your tattoo will cost to ask. Generally the price for a tattoo smaller than your palm will be quoted as a flat rate. Something larger than this is usually quoted at an hourly rate. Your artist can give you an estimate on how long the work would take them, multiply that by their hourly rate and you’ll have a good idea of the total cost.</p>
                <strong>How long will my tattoo take?</strong>
                <p>As with price, the amount of time a tattoo will take depends on a variety of factors. Asking your artist is the best way to get an accurate idea of the time you will need to set aside for your tattoo.</p>
                <strong>Can I walk-in or do I need an appointment?</strong>
                <p>A tattoo about the size of your hand can usually be done as a walk-in. Each artist has posted their walk-in availability on their portfolio page. Clients will be helped on a first-come, first-served basis during these times. If it’s not something that can be drawn and completed during the walk-in hours, your walk-in time can be spent consulting with your artist and making a future appointment. Best not to rush these things!</p>
                <strong>How do I make an appointment?</strong>
                <p>If you have an artist in mind, contact them directly as each artist keeps their own schedule. If you have not selected an artist and would like us to recommend someone based on your design concept, please email us at the shop: cousinpaulstattoo@gmail.com</p>
                <strong>I know I want a tattoo, but I don’t know what I want. What should I do?</strong>
                <p>Spend some time looking at tattoos online or browsing through the artist portfolios on our website. Even looking at images of things you enjoy may help spark inspiration. We recommend that you have an idea about what you want before you make a consultation with an artist. Artists can help by talking things out with you, but the more clearly you are able to describe what you want, the more quickly and easily your artist can create a custom design for you.</p>
                <strong>Can I bring pictures of tattoos, or images I like, with me?</strong>
                <p>Absolutely. Images of tattoos or subject matter that you like can help an artist get direction in designing a tattoo that you will love. We will generally not give you the exact tattoo that someone else has (the exceptions being logos, basic-font lettering, and things that have to be exactly the same), we are artists after all, and like to have a hand in designing a custom tattoo for you!</p>
                <strong>Does it hurt?</strong>
                <p>We’d be lying if we told you it doesn’t hurt, but it’s not unbearable. It’s been described as a scratching/burning sensation. You’ll be better prepared to manage the pain if you’ve come in for your session mentally and physically prepared to be tattooed.</p>
                <strong>What should I do to prepare for my tattoo appointment?</strong>
                <p>We recommend you eat a good meal a few hours before your tattoo appointment, drink plenty of water, and get plenty of rest in the days before your appointment. Being physically and mentally prepared for being tattooed will help you sit better so that you get the best tattoo possible. It is not recommended that you try to get tattooed while sick. Your artist will understand if you need to reschedule, and being healthy and ready the day of your appointment is important. Keep your skin protected from the sun. Your artist cannot tattoo your sunburned skin. Avoid drinking heavily the days prior to your tattoo appointment, as hangovers and dehydration affect how easy your skin is to work with and can impact how well you are able to sit during the session.</p>
                <strong>Can I see the artwork for my tattoo before my appointment?</strong>
                <p>For the most part, your artist will present their design to you when you arrive for your appointment. If seeing the artwork prior to the day of your appointment is important to you, please have this discussion with your artist during the consultation. Otherwise, your artist will typically allow enough time during your session to make minor revisions to the design. Because artists charge for their time spent tattooing you and the artwork is created at no charge, don’t expect that the artist will give you the artwork before it’s tattooed on you without charging something for their time.</p>
                <strong>I want a tattoo, but the price was too high. What should I do?</strong>
                <p>If you’re on a specific budget let your artist know. There are often changes that can be made to the design that can help meet your budget. That being said, haggling for a lower price for the same design is generally considered to be impolite. Your artist knows what their work is worth, and they are pricing it accordingly. They want to do the best tattoo that they can for you, and the pricing reflects what it will take them to do that.</p>
                <strong>I have been told that what I want tattooed isn’t possible, isn’t a good idea, or has to be way bigger than I want. What should I do?</strong>
                <p>Listen to your tattoo artist. It’s our job to tattoo you, and do the best job possible so that you get the best possible tattoo and love it forever. A tattoo isn’t a drawing on paper. Some things just don’t work in the skin, and everyone’s skin is different, so what works for one person may not work for someone else. Our artists will be happy to explain to you why something is, or isn’t a good idea to do, and some may even recommend another artist if the doesn’t suit them or their style.</p>
                <strong>Should I tip my artist?</strong>
                <p>Your artist is going to work very hard to make a tattoo for you that will look good and last forever. Showing some appreciation for this is definitely recommended. Tattoo artists rarely get to keep the total amount that they charge you for your tattoo. The lion’s share may go to paying the rent for the shop or booth they work out of, and for the materials they use to actually make your tattoo. Tipping shows your artist that you appreciate the work they do for you, and helps them to be able to continue doing business and tattooing to the best of their ability.</p>
                <strong>Can I bring my child to my tattoo appointment?</strong>
                <p>Cousin Paul’s has a strict no children policy. The imagery and conversation in the tattoo shop may not be suitable for children. Also, no matter how well-behaved they may be, children can present a distraction to both you and your artist. If your sitter bailed, it’s best to call your artist and reschedule your appointment.</p>
                <strong>Can my friend come with me?</strong>
                <p>Friends may accompany you to your tattoo appointment, but we would prefer only one to two extra people at maximum. Any more than this and the artist’s area can become too crowded and this may be distracting for your artist. Please be respectful of other clients and the artists by not bringing a group of people with you.</p>
                <strong>Does Cousin Paul’s offer piercings?</strong>
                <p>At this time, we do not, however we have plans to offer piercings in the future. Keep an eye on our Facebook and Instagram for shop news and updates!</p>
                <strong>What do I do to take care of my tattoo?</strong>
                <p>Each artist will provide you an after-care sheet at the time of your appointment and will walk you through things like how long the bandage should stay on and how often to wash and moisturize it in the following days. You will need to keep your new tattoo out of the sun, keep clothing from sticking to it, avoid swimming, and generally be gentle with it and keep it clean. If you have any questions or think that there may be a problem with your tattoo, contact your artist as soon as possible.</p>
                <strong>Can you fix my old tattoo?</strong>
                <p>We do a lot of cover-ups. The first step is to meet with your artist in person. After seeing the existing tattoo they can then help devise a design and a placement that would best re-work or cover your existing tattoo.</p>
